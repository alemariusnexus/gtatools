/**
 *	An access interface for a single module that is interested in accessing a DisplayedEntity.
 *
 *	Access to DisplayedEntities, especially to actions which modify their content, or access to notification of
 *	changes to them, are managed through this class. Every module/subsystem that has an interest to modify a
 *	particular DisplayedEntity, or to be notified when other modules make changes to them, creates its own
 *	DisplayedEntityHandler, through which it gains access to these features.
 *
 *	If such a module wants to make any changes to the DisplayedEntity, it first has to acquire an edit lock.
 *	Only one DisplayedEntityHandler can have an active edit lock at any point in time. This ensures that
 *	no two modules modify the same DisplayedEntity at the same time, which would mean that if both modules
 *	want to save their changes, these changes would have to be merged, which isn't always possible.
 *
 *	For managing changes to the entity, each DisplayedEntityHandler has its own QUndoStack. Note that by
 *	default, none of the QUndoStack signals is connected to a slot here, so if e.g. the QUndoStack becomes
 *	clean, this does not automatically release the edit lock, although this behavior might be useful.
 *
 *	This class (or subclasses of it) is also responsible to actually save whatever changes were made to
 *	the DisplayedEntity. When changes are to be saved, the method doSaveChanges() is called.
