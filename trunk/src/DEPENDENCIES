Here are the dependencies for parts of the gtatools


-------------------------
libgtaformats
-------------------------

Optional:
	- libsquish: DXT (de-)compression library. Needed for support of DXT-compressed TXD textures. If you
	  don't want to use it, set GF_USE_SQUISH to false.
	  WARNING: Usage of libsquish might be illegal in some states (most notably the USA) without paying
	  license fees because of software patents.
	  

	  
-------------------------
libgta
-------------------------

Required:
	- OpenGL: At least OpenGL 2.1 with GLU is needed
	- GLEW: The OpenGL Extension Wrangler library
	- libgtaformats: You should use the same libgtaformats version as for libgta
	
Optional:
	- libsquish: Normally not needed if your graphics card supports the GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc
	  extension (which all modern cards should support). Otherwise you need libsquish for DXT-compressed
	  TXD textures.

	  

-------------------------
gtatools-gui
-------------------------
Required:
	- OpenGL: At least OpenGL 2.1 with GLU is needed
	- GLEW: The OpenGL Extension Wrangler library
	- libgtaformats: You should use the same libgtaformats version as for gtatools-gui
	- libgta: You should use the same libgta version as for gtatools-gui
	- Qt: At least version 4.6 is needed. The following components are needed: QtCore, QtGui, QtXml, QtOpenGL
	
Optional:
	- libsquish: Needed for support of DXT-compressed textures (Viewing of models with DXT-compressed
	  textures might work without libsquish if your graphics card supports GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc,
	  but for standard texture displaying you need libsquish)
