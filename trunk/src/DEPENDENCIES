Here are the dependencies for parts of the gtatools


-------------------------
libgtaformats
-------------------------

Required:
	- The Boost::smart_ptr header-only library

Optional:
	- libsquish: DXT (de-)compression library. Needed for support of DXT-compressed TXD textures. If you
	  don't want to use it, set GTAFORMATS_ENABLE_SQUISH to false.
	  WARNING: Usage of libsquish might be illegal in some states (most notably the USA) without paying
	  license fees because of software patents. In such states, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED to use libsquish with
	  gtatools!
	- PVRTexLib: Needed for support of PVRTC-compressed textures. If you don't want to use it, set
	  GTAFORMATS_ENABLE_PVRTEXLIB to false. PVRTC-compressed textures don't appear in and are not supported by
	  the original games, but are supported as an extension by gtatools, so you need PVRTexLib only when you
	  use modified files which use this extension.
	  WARNING: PVRTexLib is a proprietary library and support for it is therefore disabled by default. You
	  are, however, allowed to use it with gtatools because of an additional permission granted to you under
	  the GPL. See the file GPLADDITIONS for more information.
	  

	  
-------------------------
libgta
-------------------------

Required:
	- OpenGL: At least OpenGL 2.1 with GLU is needed
	- GLEW: The OpenGL Extension Wrangler library
	- libgtaformats: You should use the same libgtaformats version as for libgta
	
Optional:
	- libsquish: Normally not needed if your graphics card supports the GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc
	  extension (which all modern cards should support). Otherwise you need libsquish for DXT-compressed
	  TXD textures.
	  WARNING: See dependencies for libgtaformats
	- PVRTexLib: Needed for PVRTC-compressed textures if your graphics card does not support the
	  GL_IMG_texture_compression_pvrtc extension, which is the case for, as far as I know, all graphics cards
	  except PowerVR ones. See the dependencies of libgtaformats for more information.
	  WARNING: See dependencies for libgtaformats

	  

-------------------------
gtatools-gui
-------------------------
Required:
	- OpenGL: At least OpenGL 2.1 with GLU is needed
	- GLEW: The OpenGL Extension Wrangler library
	- libgtaformats: You should use the same libgtaformats version as for gtatools-gui
	- libgta: You should use the same libgta version as for gtatools-gui
	- Qt: At least version 4.6 is needed. The following components are needed: QtCore, QtGui, QtXml, QtOpenGL
	
Optional:
	- libsquish: Needed for support of DXT-compressed textures (Viewing of models with DXT-compressed
	  textures might work without libsquish if your graphics card supports GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc,
	  but for standard texture displaying you need libsquish)
	  WARNING: See dependencies for libgtaformats
	- PVRTexLib: Needed for support of PVRTC-compressed textures (Viewing of models with PVRTC-compressed
	  textures might work without PVRTexLib if your graphics card supports GL_IMG_texture_compression_pvrtc,
	  but for standard texture displaying you need PVRTexLib). See the dependencies of libgta and
	  libgtaformats for more information.
	  WARNING: See dependencies for libgtaformats
