 * 	GXT Tables are named containers f√ºr GXT entries. A GXT entry consists of a key and a value (the actual
 * 	text). The format of the key differs between GXT versions and is either a plain string or a CRC32 hash.
 * 	Entries are all stored in a given internal encoding and convenience methods are provided to convert them
 * 	to other encodings. Note that values won't automatically be encoded in the internal encoding if you
 * 	insert them. It's just a hint for the conversion functions.
