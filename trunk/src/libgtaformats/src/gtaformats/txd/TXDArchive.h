/**	\brief Represents a GTA TXD archive.
 *
 *	This class is a high-level representation of the GTA Texture Dictionary (TXD) files. A TXD file contains
 *	a number of textures in different formats. Each texture consists of a header and the texture data (and
 *	probably something else, because <i>in theory</i>, TXD is an extensible format).
 *
 *	This class loads the complete archive content into memory on initialization and provides an interface to
 *	work with this data. The archive content is internally represented using an RWSection object.
 *
 *	If you use this class to write to TXD files, you have to be careful to choose only texture properties
 *	which are supported by the original GTA if you want to use them for it. Which combinations are actually
 *	supported isn't known very well, so basically you have to test and hope. One thing known to cause
 *	problems is using mipmaps in uncompressed textures, but there will sure be others, too.
 *
 *	\warning All writing access to TXD files is <b>experimental</b>, so <b>backup</b> your files before you
 *		write anything!
