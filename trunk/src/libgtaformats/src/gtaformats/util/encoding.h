 * 	function returns the number of bytes written to dest, or a value lower than 0 in case of an error.
 *
 * 	@param src The buffer to read from.
 * 	@param srcBytes The number of bytes to read from src.
 * 	@param dest The buffer to transcode to.
 * 	@param destBytes The maximum number of bytes to be written to dest.
 * 	@param srcEnc The encoding of the string in src.
 * 	@param destEnc The encoding to be used in dest.
 * 	@return The number of bytes transcoded to dest or a value lower than 0 in case of an error. Possible
 * 		errors are ERR_INVALID_PARAMETERS, ERR_INVALID_SEQUENCE or ERR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER. The latter means
 * 		that dest isn't large enough for the transcoded string. If this is the case, dest will be filled
 * 		with as much bytes as fit in (CAUTION: This can lead to truncated unicode sequences!)
