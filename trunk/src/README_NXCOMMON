You can build nxcommon/libnxcommon along with gtatools. To do so, place the root folder of a nxcommon source distribution
under the name "nxcommon" into this directory, so that ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/nxcommon/src/CMakeLists.txt is found.
You have
to do this before building up a CMake cache. If you do so with an old CMake cache, nxcommon will not be found, so you
have to delete and rebuild your cache from scratch.

NOTE: You HAVE to place the root folder of nxcommon here, NOT just the one of libnxcommon, because some CMake utility
	functions might be missing otherwise!
